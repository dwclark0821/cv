                <p> I was originally born in Memphis, TN and lived there most of my life until I turned 18 and went to College
                at the University of Arkansas. I majored in Criminal Justice and commissioned into the U.S. Army n 2014
                after completing the ROTC program. I served for four years in the Army as an Armor and Signal Officer
                and completed one tour of duty in the Middle East. In 2018, I transitioned to the civilian sector where I
                worked as a Reliability Engineer at the Hall Tank Company. In 2019, the opportunity arose for me to join
                Southwest Power Pool as a Planning Analyst and I have now been working here for two years.</p></td>
